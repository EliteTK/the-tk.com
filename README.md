==========

This is the content generator and content for the website:
[the-tk.com](https://the-tk.com/).

It uses the new NRATL template language which utilises the sophisticated
technology of copy and paste to quickly and automatically generate content. It
is in its initial stages so expect bugs.

To build the website run `make`. To build a tarball run `make tarball`.

The actual system used for building the project is licensed under the GPLv3,
the content however is most likely going to be CC BY-SA 4.0 licensed.
