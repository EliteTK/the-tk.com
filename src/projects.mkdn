Projects
========
Here is a list of notable projects, information about each can be found in the
README.md located in the root directory of each project on gihtub.


 - __[c-stuff](https://github.com/EliteTK/c-stuff/ "EliteTK/c-stuff · GitHub")__ -
   This is a large collection of small projects and tests, there is
   stuff here which some might find useful. Most of the code is licensed under
   the GPLv3.


 - __[the-tk.com](https://github.com/EliteTK/the-tk.com/ "EliteTK/the-tk.com · GitHub")__ -
   This is the source of this website, it is a giant hack, I am hoping to
   improve the entire idea because right now it is a rather cumbersome thing.


 - __[vav](https://github.com/EliteTK/vav/ "EliteTK/vav · GitHub")__ -
   VAV (Very Awesome Vectors) is a C library which aims to provide neat looking
   vectors in C. These might not be entirely practical since they cause quite
   an overhead in the creation and calculations using vectors, but the code can
   be a source of interesting ideas.


 - __[minecurses](https://github.com/EliteTK/minecurses/ "EliteTK/minecurses · GitHub")__
   This is a clone of minesweeper written in C using ncurses. The code is quite
   awful in the current master branch and the redo branch is not in any way
   able to be compiled. However, in the future this might possibly improve. A
   -git package can be found in the Arch Linux AUR.


 - __[dotfiles](http://github.com/EliteTK/dotfiles/ "EliteTK/dotfiles · GitHub")__
   These are the files from my .config directory, the only things which are
   actually useful may be the vimrc, i3 config and i3blocks config.
